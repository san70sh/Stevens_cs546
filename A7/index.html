      <h2>My Life until now:</h2>
      <p>
        It's been 3 years since I had last touched a textbook. Everyday has been work, work and work. Don't misunderstand, work is fun.
         But sometimes, you feel like doing something out of routine, but then you realise you never got the time. Often there were also times
         when you feel stagnant and desire for things to be different. Then came a day when I said enough is enough. I finally took the step 
         to quit my job and began my journey to pursue Masters, start off from the basics, rebuild myself from the ground and kickstart a new phase in life.
