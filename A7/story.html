    <h1>The time I went to Central Park</h1>
    <a>
      We got down at the Natural History Musuem and our plan was to go to the Belvidere Castle, but we took a wrong turn ending up at Frisbee Hill.
      Luckily, we bought a frisbee beforehand to play, but the fricking thing never worked. Turned out the product was flawed, its center of mass was not proper.
      There was a pond nearby, where we went next. There was a castle across the pond, so we got a paddleboat to get the castle. After taking a couple of 
      photos at the castle, we wanted  to go to Bow Bridge.  On the way, we walked along a lake with a scenic view of the Harlem Cathedral. We got hungry
      walking around, so we found a picnic spot and made a Indian snack 'Bhel'. Later, as night fell and temperature fell, we realised it got too late, so 
      we went to Burlington, bought some clothes, a fancy leather pants and went back home.
